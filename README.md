# Predictive-Analytics-for-Injury-Prevention-Machine-Learning-Approaches-in-Competitive-Sports
This project leverages machine learning to predict injury risk and recovery time in athletes, using historical data to identify key factors such as past injuries and high training intensity. Comprehensive data preprocessing was conducted, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and addressing class imbalances using pandas and scikit-learn to prepare the dataset for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved generating statistical summaries and visualizing relationships between features using Seaborn and Matplotlib, uncovering patterns and correlations that influenced injury likelihood and recovery. Supervised learning models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Logistic Regression, were developed to predict recovery time and injury likelihood, with model performance evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, Accuracy, F1 Score, and Precision. Regularization techniques were applied to improve robustness and mitigate overfitting. Visualizations of feature importance and model coefficients provided actionable insights into factors affecting athlete health. By integrating data-driven findings, the project demonstrated the significant role of training intensity and injury history in guiding targeted care and intervention strategies. This work showcased proficiency in Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, as well as skills in data engineering, statistical analysis, and machine learning. The project outcomes provide a foundation for optimizing injury prevention and recovery strategies for athletes.
